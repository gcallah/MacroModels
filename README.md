# MacroModels
Some macroeconomic models:
* Keynesian Cross
* Real growth, nominal growth and inflation calculator.
* PPF model (in progress)

All of these are built on a minimal data entry model; for instance, for the Keynesian Cross, you only need enter autonomous consumption, marginal propensity to consume, and intended investment, and the whole kit and caboodle recalculates from there. For the PPF, you just enter a maximum number of units, and everything recalculates: great for showing a collapsing or expanding PPF.

You are welcome to use these in your classes.
